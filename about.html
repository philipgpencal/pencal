                                <p>I’m a brazilian software engineer who spend the whole day, practically every day,
                                    working with .NET technologies, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
                                    dabbling with React and Node.js; and trying to collect potentially usefull
                                    information through a few hundred of tech web sites. I build softwares and systems
                                    used in diverse companies. I love do it well. I’m curious, and I enjoy work that
                                    challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my
                                    best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges
                                    with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub
                                    will give you a good idea of the types of technologies I prefer to be using. I also
                                    love to read technicals books, the Robert Cecil Martin books are my favorite ones.

                                <p>
                                    At the moment, I’m a senior consultant at Altran Technologies in Porto, Portugal.
                                    But my career started so far away from here, in the agitated city of Curitiba in
                                    Brazil, where I also born and grow up. In September 2010, still in high school, I
                                    was looking for an internship and I got the opportunity to work in a tech startup
                                    who is responsible for the truck sellers' digital market. I worked there for almost
                                    a year where I deeped in the tech world, programming languages, and web concepts. I
                                    remember at that time I didn't realize how to dealing with the huge and massive
                                    study content to reach my personal goal, become a computer programming.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since that time, I never stopped to study, five hours week at least. I started to
                                    feel that sensation of thirst for knowledge and I realized I needed to worked in a
                                    big company to improve my skills. This thirst moved me to one of the biggest HR
                                    companies in Brazil, were four good years with many projects, challenges, knowledge
                                    acquired. I still remember the happy feeling just after solved a critical bug or
                                    completing to building a complex algorithm and see it works and brings benefits to
                                    the systems and their users. That's really amazing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After four long years, I decided to put my career on an international road. I moved
                                    to a new company with new challenges, technologies, and the possibility to start to
                                    see the English language on the systems. I know it can be little strange, but it
                                    made all difference to me. In Brazil, we have not a good basic education on public
                                    schools and you must learn English by yourself if you want to reach an acceptable
                                    English level. Anyway, after a long year working with complex port systems, I
                                    received an invitation to participate in a hiring processing for a developer
                                    position in one of the most valuable and rich oil companies in the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It's definitely was a game changer in my career, I started to work with teams in
                                    different parts of the world, start to understand how big corporations work, the
                                    timezones, cultures, rules and process for everything. I really enjoyed to worked
                                    there, besides increasing my programming skills, I also improved my English and made
                                    good friends. At that time I had worked in all types of company, startups, familiar,
                                    medium, large and global companies. But I had never worked at home before. So I
                                    decided to try, It was one of the most difficult decisions that I ever made, I was
                                    quitting a dream job in a big and awarded company with a possibility to make a
                                    brilliant career there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After my decision, I started to work at home for an American digital marketing
                                    company. Where I had the biggest technical progression in my career until now, I was
                                    deeply involved in new technologies, the blockchain was just a "complex word" when
                                    we start to implement a token in a company business model, here I became blockchain
                                    expert. I also learned some data science concepts with my high skilled coworkers,
                                    It's definitely changed my vision about software architecture.

                                    At the beginning of 2019 I decided to reach one of my most ambitious goals, live and
                                    work abroad. Everything went well on the interview and here I am on Portugal working
                                    for Altran.

                                    I usually say god has strange ways to put you in the right path, I think my entire
                                    career can be summed up in this sentence.

                                <p>
                                    I was born in 1991 in Curitiba, Brazil. The capital of the state of Parana, I grew
                                    up doing what every kid and teenage does, I played a lot of video games and as a
                                    good Brazilian, I also played soccer while studying in a public high school. At the
                                    end of high school, I met my true love and with that, I changed my concept of life
                                    (Oh yes, so early). I started to create goals lists and planning how I could reach
                                    each one of them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I adopted a dog (one of my passions), got a degree and then a specialization degree
                                    in software engineer, I married, started to get interested for finances market as a
                                    hobby, data science became fascinating to me. I usually spend some time of my free
                                    time studying it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With my career was progressing we decided to left Curitiba, where It was my home for
                                    over 27 years. I'm still fanatic for soccer, Netflix and sometimes I still play
                                    video games, some things never change. Now I'm a married man with no children (for
                                    now) living in a different country, with a different culture, with 8.508 km between
                                    me and my relatives. This can be scared sometimes, but I'm really proud of my
                                    trajectory until here. Who knows what the destiny reserve for us, destiny is all.
